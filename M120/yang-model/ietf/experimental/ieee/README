IEEE experimental drafts

(1) The "experimental/ieee" branch is intended for IEEE work that does not yet have a Project Authorization Request (PAR).

(2) The "standard/ieee" branch is intended for approved PARs, for drafts as well as published standards.

(3) Within "experimental/ieee" and "standard/ieee", use a branch name with the number of the IEEE Working Group (e.g. "802.1", "1588").
