## OpenConfig

[**OpenConfig**](http://www.openconfig.net) is a collaborative effort by network operators to develop programmatic interfaces and tools for managing networks in a dynamic, vendor-neutral way.

OpenConfig models are now available from the OpenConfig public [GitHub repository](https://github.com/openconfig/public).
